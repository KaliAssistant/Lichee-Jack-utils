Description: fast, modern, secure kernel VPN tunnel (userland utilities)
 WireGuard is a novel VPN that runs inside the Linux Kernel and uses

 than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for
 running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for
 many different circumstances. It runs over UDP.
